title: On Writing and Startups
---

Writing is like a journey with many paths to potentially move down. There’s almost always lots of legitimate options to continue off of the previous sentence, and decisions early on can significantly impact the logical chain that follows. Many of the paths can be interesting and worthwhile, the issue for most people is they get stuck at some point and the writing dies. 

A startup is somewhat similar. Decisions you make can build on each other and lead down lots of interesting roads, many of which are valuable, profitable and worth doing. The biggest mistake is to get stuck somewhere along the way and stop moving, especially for the fear you’re not moving down the exactly optimal path. Every decision you make, every small problem that comes up is a potential block that might stop your movement so don’t let it. Just keep the story going forward even if you don’t know exactly where it will end up.
